    ScriptedHandoff --> Anon: returns to Anonymous gating rules\n(if escalated from Anonymous)
    ScriptedHandoff --> Ver: returns to Verified gating rules\n(if escalated from Verified)

    note right of ScriptedHandoff
        Entirely cosmetic. No real human,
        no ticketing system, no external handoff.
        Critically: gating rules from 6.2 still
        apply underneath — "Melany" cannot
        disclose shipment data to a visitor
        who escalated while still Anonymous.
